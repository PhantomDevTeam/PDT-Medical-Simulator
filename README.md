# Simple ACE Medical Simulator

### See license for on that stuff
  The gist of it is do whatever you want
  
### Patients are spawned and cleared from the laptop in-front of the tent

There are three difficulties to choose from: easy, medium, and hard - these may need to be tweaked, let me know.

Difficulty|Description
----------|-----------
Easy      | Small/minor wounds over the body. Should be pretty easy to fix.
Medium    | A bit more complecated, small/medium/large wounds expected. A decent challenge.
Hard      | Hardest, lots of large/medium wounds and quick bleedouts. "You won't survive".

### Fully KAT compatible
